Objective: Write code to create an effective differential equation simulator for a given task.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

You must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly improve the code to create the most accurate and realistic simulator possible.
You always write out the code contents. You always indent code with tabs.
You cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a machine. The code can include black box multi-layer perceptions where required.

Use the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.

You will get a system description to code a differential equation simulator for.

System Description:```
Treatment Response Model for GIST under Multiple Targeted Therapies (CBIO Dataset)

Here you must model the state differential of tumor_size, msi_score, and tmb_nonsynonymous; with the control input of treatment_duration. This model captures longitudinal tumor dynamics and genomic features across multiple treatment types including IMATINIB, SUNITINIB, REGORAFENIB, and other targeted therapies.

IMPORTANT: The forward() method MUST accept exactly 4 separate tensor arguments in this order: tumor_size, msi_score, tmb_nonsynonymous, treatment_duration. Do NOT concatenate them into a single input tensor.

CRITICAL: The forward() method MUST return EXACTLY 3 values (d_tumor_size__dt, d_msi_score__dt, d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt). Do NOT return a derivative for treatment_duration as it is a control input, not a state variable.

Description of the variables:
* tumor_size: Tumor size in cm (longest diameter). Observable state variable that changes over time during treatment. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)
* msi_score: Microsatellite instability score. A genomic biomarker that may evolve during treatment. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)
* tmb_nonsynonymous: Tumor mutational burden (count of nonsynonymous mutations). Another genomic feature tracked over time. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)
* treatment_duration: Duration of treatment in days. This is the control input variable representing how long the patient has been on treatment. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)

Time units:
* days (treatment_duration represents cumulative days of treatment)

Value ranges:
* tumor_size: [1.0, 30.0] cm (longest diameter)
* msi_score: [0.0, 10.0] (normalized score)
* tmb_nonsynonymous: [0.0, 3.0] (normalized mutation count)
* treatment_duration: [0, 2000] days

Training dataset:
* Longitudinal observations from GIST patients with diverse treatment regimens (IMATINIB, SUNITINIB, REGORAFENIB, EVEROLIMUS, and others)
* Treatment durations ranging from days to years
* Includes treatment response categories: CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response), SD (Stable Disease), PD (Progressive Disease), NR (No Response)
* Dataset includes genetic mutation profiles (KIT, TP53, RB1, SDHB, MTOR, NF1, TSC2)
* The model should predict how tumor_size, msi_score, and tmb_nonsynonymous change over treatment_duration

The model has three separate paths for each of the state variables, each path consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a ReLU activation function, another fully connected layer, another ReLU activation, and finally a fully connected layer that outputs the derivative of the state variable with respect to time. The model does not take into account the interaction between the state variables."
