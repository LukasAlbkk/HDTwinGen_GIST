You always indent code with tabs.\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a machine.

This model captures longitudinal tumor dynamics across multiple treatment types including IMATINIB, SUNITINIB, REGORAFENIB, and other targeted therapies.\n\nDescription of the variables:\n* tumor_volume: Tumor volume in cm^3. Derive from tumor_size (cm; longest diameter) via V = (\u03c0/6) * (tumor_size)^3.\n* drug_concentration: Plasma concentration of active treatment agent (mg/L), modeled with a one-compartment PK (first-order elimination) with optional absorption/lag as needed.\n* treatment_dosage: Daily dose of active treatment (mg/day), piecewise-constant control that varies by treatment type (e.g., IMATINIB: 400-800 mg/day, SUNITINIB: 37.5-50 mg/day, REGORAFENIB: 160 mg/day).\n\nTime units:\n* days (treatment_duration_days available in dataset; can be converted to months if needed: months = days/30.44)\n\nValue ranges:\n* tumor_volume: [0.5, 13500] cm^3 (derived from dataset tumor_size range ~1-30 cm)\n* drug_concentration: [0, 15] mg/L (accounting for multiple drug types with different PK profiles)\n* treatment_dosage: [0, 800] mg/day (standardized range across treatment types)\n\nTraining dataset:\n* Longitudinal observations from GIST patients with diverse treatment regimens (IMATINIB, SUNITINIB, REGORAFENIB, EVEROLIMUS, and others)\n* Treatment durations ranging from days to years (treatment_duration_days)\n* Includes treatment response categories: CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response), SD (Stable Disease), PD (Progressive Disease), NR (No Response)\n* Dataset includes genetic mutation profiles (KIT, TP53, RB1, SDHB, MTOR, NF1, TSC2)\n", "function_call": {"name": "complete_StateDifferential_code"}}], "simulator_code_dict": {}, "steps": [], "step": null, "meta_messages": [], "message_hash": "b2aebe70b6d4fdaa2ab468bb4007115bce16345f2857241d4c9c023527af9106"}
