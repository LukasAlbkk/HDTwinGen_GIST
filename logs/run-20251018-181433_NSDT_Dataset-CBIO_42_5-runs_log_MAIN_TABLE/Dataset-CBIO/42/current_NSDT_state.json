Code must ONLY fill the provided class skeleton.\n\nINPUTS (order is FIXED; each is a [B,1] tensor):\n1. tumor_size (STATE)               [1.0\u201330.0] cm\n2. msi_score (STATE)                [0.0\u201310.0]\n3. tmb_nonsynonymous (STATE)        [0.0\u20133.0]\n4. mitotic_rate (STATE)             [0.0\u2013100.0]\n5. age_at_diagnosis (STATIC)        [20\u201390] years\n6. stage_encoded (STATIC)           {0=Localized,1=Metastatic}\n7. treatment_encoded (STATIC)       {0=IMATINIB,1=SUNITINIB,2=REGORAFENIB,3=TRIAL,4=OTHER}\n8. has_kit_mutation (STATIC)        {0/1}\n9. tumor_purity (STATIC)            [0\u2013100] %\n10. site_small_intestine (STATIC)   {0/1}\n11. site_stomach (STATIC)           {0/1}\n12. treatment_duration (CONTROL)    [0\u20132000] days (cumulative)\n\nOUTPUT (order is FIXED; each [B,1]):\nreturn (d_tumor_size__dt, d_msi_score__dt, d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt, d_mitotic_rate__dt)\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (must implement):\n1) DO NOT use BatchNorm. If normalizing hidden reps, use LayerNorm.\n2) Treatment MUST matter and be **monotone suppressive** for tumor_size:\n   Implement a non-negative gate \u03b3(x) = Softplus(MLP(all 12 inputs)) and apply:\n   d_tumor_size__dt = d_tumor_size__dt - \u03b3 * treatment_duration\n   This ensures higher treatment_duration makes growth less positive (or more negative).\n3) Stability: clamp derivatives to plausible ranges, e.g.:\n   d_tumor_size__dt \u2208 [-5, 5], d_msi_score__dt \u2208 [-1, 1], d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt \u2208 [-0.05, 0.05], d_mitotic_rate__dt \u2208 [-10, 10].\n4) Activation & regularization: use LeakyReLU (or ELU), Dropout in [0.1,0.3]. Avoid exploding weights.\n5) Personalization: allow STATIC features to modulate the dynamics (e.g., via learned gates/embeddings or by concatenation into the MLP).\n6) Assertions: inside forward, assert concatenated input has last-dim = 12. Never return NaN/Inf.\n\nRECOMMENDED BLUEPRINT (simple and effective - SMALL MODEL for 625 observations):\n- Concatenate ALL 12 inputs into x (dim=-1).\n- MLP block (SMALL to prevent overfitting): Linear(12\u2192128) \u2192 LayerNorm(128) \u2192 LeakyReLU \u2192 Dropout(0.3) \u2192 Linear(128\u219264) \u2192 LayerNorm(64) \u2192 LeakyReLU \u2192 Dropout(0.3) \u2192 Linear(64\u21924).\n- Split outputs into (d_tumor, d_msi, d_tmb, d_mitotic).\n- Monotone treatment gate (SMALL): \u03b3 = Softplus(Linear(12\u219232)\u2192LeakyReLU\u2192Dropout(0.3)\u2192Linear(32\u21921)).\n- Apply d_tumor \u2190 d_tumor - \u03b3 * treatment_duration.\n- Clamp all four derivatives to the given ranges.\n- Return them in the exact required order.\n\nIMPORTANT: Use SMALLER hidden layers (128, 64, 32) and HIGHER dropout (0.3) to prevent overfitting on small dataset (625 obs).\n\nMEDICAL PRIOR (lightweight; do NOT overconstrain):\n- Tumor growth tends to slow as mass increases (implicit via MLP + clamp).\n- Longer effective treatment typically reduces net growth \u2192 enforced by the monotone gate.\n- MSI/TMB/mitotic_rate change slowly vs tumor_size; keep derivative magnitudes small (use clamps).\n\nEVALUATION GUARD (implement as inline sanity checks / comments):\n- For a random batch, compute outputs twice: with treatment_duration=0 vs +1000. Ensure d_tumor_size__dt with +1000 is <= the value with 0 (monotone).\n- Ensure shapes: all inputs [B,1], concatenation \u2192 last-dim=12, outputs split in 4\u00d7[B,1].\n\nVARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS (for context):\nSTATE VARIABLES (require derivatives):\n* tumor_size: Primary outcome measure, cm (longest diameter)\n* msi_score: Microsatellite instability (genomic biomarker)\n* tmb_nonsynonymous: Tumor mutational burden (mutation count)\n* mitotic_rate: Proliferation rate (mitoses per 50 HPF)\n\nSTATIC FEATURES (NO derivatives - patient characteristics):\n* age_at_diagnosis: Patient age in years\n* stage_encoded: 0=Localized, 1=Metastatic\n* treatment_encoded: 0=IMATINIB (1st line), 1=SUNITINIB (2nd line), 2=REGORAFENIB (3rd line), 3=TRIAL, 4=OTHER\n* has_kit_mutation: 0=No, 1=Yes (KIT+ tumors respond better to IMATINIB)\n* tumor_purity: Percentage of tumor cells (affects biomarker reliability)\n* site_small_intestine: 1=Small Intestine, 0=Other\n* site_stomach: 1=Stomach, 0=Other\n\nCONTROL INPUT:\n* treatment_duration: Cumulative days of treatment (MUST suppress tumor growth monotonically)\n"}], "simulator_code_dict": {"val_loss": 28.987037658691406, "train_loss": 44.69786071777344, "test_loss": 26.032590866088867, "optimized_parameters": {}, "loss_per_dim_dict": {"tumor_size": 10.548481941223145, "msi_score": 0.48773857951164246, "tmb_nonsynonymous": 0.00042124418541789055, "mitotic_rate": 104.91150665283203}, "StateDifferential_code": "import torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\nclass StateDifferential(nn.Module):\n\tdef __init__(self):\n\t\tsuper(StateDifferential, self).__init__()\n\t\tself.mlp = nn.Sequential(\n\t\t\tnn.Linear(12, 256),  # Increased capacity\n\t\t\tnn.LayerNorm(256),\n\t\t\tnn.ELU(),  # Changed to ELU\n\t\t\tnn.Dropout(0.2),  # Adjusted dropout\n\t\t\tnn.Linear(256, 128),\n\t\t\tnn.LayerNorm(128),\n\t\t\tnn.ELU(),\n\t\t\tnn.Dropout(0.2),\n\t\t\tnn.Linear(128, 4)\n\t\t)\n\t\tself.treatment_gate = nn.Sequential(\n\t\t\tnn.Linear(12, 64),  # Increased capacity\n\t\t\tnn.ELU(),\n\t\t\tnn.Dropout(0.2),\n\t\t\tnn.Linear(64, 1)\n\t\t)\n\n\tdef forward(self,\n\t\t\ttumor_size: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\tmsi_score: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\ttmb_nonsynonymous: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\tmitotic_rate: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\tage_at_diagnosis: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\tstage_encoded: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\ttreatment_encoded: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\thas_kit_mutation: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\ttumor_purity: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\tsite_small_intestine: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\tsite_stomach: torch.Tensor,\n\t\t\ttreatment_duration: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n\t\t# Concatenate inputs\n\t\tx = torch.cat((tumor_size, msi_score, tmb_nonsynonymous, mitotic_rate,\n\t\t\t\tage_at_diagnosis, stage_encoded, treatment_encoded,\n\t\t\t\thas_kit_mutation, tumor_purity, site_small_intestine, site_stomach,\n\t\t\t\ttreatment_duration), dim=-1)\n\n\t\t# Assert input shape\n\t\tassert x.shape[-1] == 12, \"Input must have last dimension of size 12\"\n\n\t\t# Compute derivatives\n\t\tderivatives = self.mlp(x)\n\t\td_tumor_size__dt, d_msi_score__dt, d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt, d_mitotic_rate__dt = derivatives.split(1, dim=-1)\n\n\t\t# Compute treatment gate\n\t\tgamma = F.softplus(self.treatment_gate(x))\n\n\t\t# Apply treatment effect on tumor size\n\t\td_tumor_size__dt = d_tumor_size__dt - gamma * treatment_duration\n\n\t\t# Clamp outputs to ensure stability\n\t\td_tumor_size__dt = torch.clamp(d_tumor_size__dt, -5, 5)\n\t\td_msi_score__dt = torch.clamp(d_msi_score__dt, -1, 1)\n\t\td_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt = torch.clamp(d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt, -0.05, 0.05)\n\t\td_mitotic_rate__dt = torch.clamp(d_mitotic_rate__dt, -10, 10)\n\n\t\t# Sanity checks\n\t\tassert not torch.isnan(d_tumor_size__dt).any(), \"Output contains NaN\"\n\t\tassert not torch.isinf(d_tumor_size__dt).any(), \"Output contains Inf\"\n\n\t\treturn d_tumor_size__dt, d_msi_score__dt, d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt, d_mitotic_rate__dt", "model_description": "This code implements an improved neural ODE-like differential model for simulating treatment responses in GIST, with increased model capacity and adjusted dropout rates."}, "steps": [], "step": null, "meta_messages": [], "message_hash": "487afce49650fde37fc82e68ed19f3034ef8036d82ac0628e47ebfb82f2e3610"}
