{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code to create an effective differential equation simulator for a given task.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\n\nYou must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly improve the code to create the most accurate and realistic simulator possible.\nYou always write out the code contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a machine. The code can include black box multi-layer perceptions where required.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nYou will get a system description to code a differential equation simulator for.\n\nSystem Description:```\nTreatment Response Model for GIST under Multiple Targeted Therapies (CBIO Dataset)\n\nHere you must model the state differential of tumor_size, msi_score, and tmb_nonsynonymous; with the control input of treatment_duration. This model captures longitudinal tumor dynamics and genomic features across multiple treatment types including IMATINIB, SUNITINIB, REGORAFENIB, and other targeted therapies.\n\nIMPORTANT: The forward() method MUST accept exactly 4 separate tensor arguments in this order: tumor_size, msi_score, tmb_nonsynonymous, treatment_duration. Do NOT concatenate them into a single input tensor.\n\nCRITICAL: The forward() method MUST return EXACTLY 3 values (d_tumor_size__dt, d_msi_score__dt, d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt). Do NOT return a derivative for treatment_duration as it is a control input, not a state variable.\n\nDescription of the variables:\n* tumor_size: Tumor size in cm (longest diameter). Observable state variable that changes over time during treatment. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)\n* msi_score: Microsatellite instability score. A genomic biomarker that may evolve during treatment. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)\n* tmb_nonsynonymous: Tumor mutational burden (count of nonsynonymous mutations). Another genomic feature tracked over time. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)\n* treatment_duration: Duration of treatment in days. This is the control input variable representing how long the patient has been on treatment. (PASSED AS SEPARATE ARGUMENT)\n\nTime units:\n* days (treatment_duration represents cumulative days of treatment)\n\nValue ranges:\n* tumor_size: [1.0, 30.0] cm (longest diameter)\n* msi_score: [0.0, 10.0] (normalized score)\n* tmb_nonsynonymous: [0.0, 3.0] (normalized mutation count)\n* treatment_duration: [0, 2000] days\n\nTraining dataset:\n* Longitudinal observations from GIST patients with diverse treatment regimens (IMATINIB, SUNITINIB, REGORAFENIB, EVEROLIMUS, and others)\n* Treatment durations ranging from days to years\n* Includes treatment response categories: CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response), SD (Stable Disease), PD (Progressive Disease), NR (No Response)\n* Dataset includes genetic mutation profiles (KIT, TP53, RB1, SDHB, MTOR, NF1, TSC2)\n* The model should predict how tumor_size, msi_score, and tmb_nonsynonymous change over treatment_duration\n"}], "simulator_code_dict": {"val_loss": 0.24004477262496948, "train_loss": 0.18364481627941132, "test_loss": 0.1359812468290329, "optimized_parameters": {}, "loss_per_dim_dict": {"tumor_size": 0.2825268805027008, "msi_score": 0.3928106129169464, "tmb_nonsynonymous": 0.0447969026863575}, "StateDifferential_code": "\n\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass StateDifferential(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(StateDifferential, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1_tumor = nn.Linear(1, 128)\n        self.fc2_tumor = nn.Linear(128, 128)\n        self.fc3_tumor = nn.Linear(128, 1)\n        self.dropout_tumor = nn.Dropout(0.2)\n\n        self.fc1_msi = nn.Linear(1, 128)\n        self.fc2_msi = nn.Linear(128, 128)\n        self.fc3_msi = nn.Linear(128, 1)\n        self.dropout_msi = nn.Dropout(0.2)\n\n        self.fc1_tmb = nn.Linear(1, 128)\n        self.fc2_tmb = nn.Linear(128, 128)\n        self.fc3_tmb = nn.Linear(128, 1)\n        self.dropout_tmb = nn.Dropout(0.2)\n\n        self.fc1_treatment = nn.Linear(1, 128)\n        self.fc2_treatment = nn.Linear(128, 128)\n        self.fc3_treatment = nn.Linear(128, 1)\n        self.dropout_treatment = nn.Dropout(0.2)\n\n    def forward(self, tumor_size, msi_score, tmb_nonsynonymous, treatment_duration):\n        # Tumor size differential\n        d_tumor_size__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc1_tumor(tumor_size))\n        d_tumor_size__dt = self.dropout_tumor(d_tumor_size__dt)\n        d_tumor_size__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc2_tumor(d_tumor_size__dt))\n        d_tumor_size__dt = self.dropout_tumor(d_tumor_size__dt)\n        d_tumor_size__dt = self.fc3_tumor(d_tumor_size__dt)\n\n        # MSI score differential\n        d_msi_score__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc1_msi(msi_score))\n        d_msi_score__dt = self.dropout_msi(d_msi_score__dt)\n        d_msi_score__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc2_msi(d_msi_score__dt))\n        d_msi_score__dt = self.dropout_msi(d_msi_score__dt)\n        d_msi_score__dt = self.fc3_msi(d_msi_score__dt)\n\n        # TMB nonsynonymous differential\n        d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc1_tmb(tmb_nonsynonymous))\n        d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt = self.dropout_tmb(d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt)\n        d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc2_tmb(d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt))\n        d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt = self.dropout_tmb(d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt)\n        d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt = self.fc3_tmb(d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt)\n\n        # Treatment duration differential\n        d_treatment_duration__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc1_treatment(treatment_duration))\n        d_treatment_duration__dt = self.dropout_treatment(d_treatment_duration__dt)\n        d_treatment_duration__dt = F.leaky_relu(self.fc2_treatment(d_treatment_duration__dt))\n        d_treatment_duration__dt = self.dropout_treatment(d_treatment_duration__dt)\n        d_treatment_duration__dt = self.fc3_treatment(d_treatment_duration__dt)\n\n        # Combine the differentials\n        d_tumor_size__dt += d_treatment_duration__dt\n        d_msi_score__dt += d_treatment_duration__dt\n        d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt += d_treatment_duration__dt\n\n        return d_tumor_size__dt, d_msi_score__dt, d_tmb_nonsynonymous__dt\n", "model_description": "This is a black box model that uses a feed-forward neural network with dropout layers to model the state differential of tumor_size, msi_score, and tmb_nonsynonymous with respect to treatment_duration.
