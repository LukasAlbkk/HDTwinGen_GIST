It uses a simple feed-forward neural network (multi-layer perceptron) to model the state differential. The model takes as input the current state and action, and outputs the change in state. The next state is then calculated by adding this change to the current state. The state in this case is a 2D vector containing the tumor volume and drug concentration, and the action is the treatment dosage. The model is fully differentiable and can be trained using gradient-based methods.\"\n}"}, "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 738, "completion_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 1089, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}]
